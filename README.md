# terraform-exercise
## TODO:
* Talk to Harit to see which region I should work in
* Create access key and secret and store them as environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* Send Harit / Harmatz the code to make sure I am not doing anything wrong
* Continue working
**Current Status:**
On my own AWS account, the terraform code works and exerything works. The problem now is that it only seems to work with a public github repo and I can't make it work with SSH, but i will leave it to later. In the current state, the application code is in HTML file, and the HTML content is in a kubernetes configmap, need to make sure that it is fine with the tech lead. One more issue is that when I press sync after pushing change to the repo, it seems to work, but it does not notice the changes automatically.
